# BasicWeatherApp

Welcome to **BasicWeatherApp**, a simple yet robust weather application built using Kotlin. This project 
is designed with scalability, testability, and maintainability in mind, making it an excellent 
demonstration of modern Android development practices.

## Overview

**BasicWeatherApp** fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in a user-friendly 
interface. The app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern combined with Clean Architecture 
principles, ensuring that the code is well-organized, testable, and easy to maintain.

## Architecture

### MVVM + Clean Architecture

The app is structured following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern combined with **Clean Architecture** 
principles. Here’s a breakdown of why this combination was chosen:

- **Separation of Concerns**: MVVM separates the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel), 
and Clean Architecture further decouples the domain layer from the data and presentation layers. 
This separation ensures that each part of the app is focused on a single responsibility, making 
it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

- **Testability**: By using MVVM and Clean Architecture, the app’s business logic is contained within 
the ViewModel and Use Cases, which can be unit tested independently of the UI. This separation allows 
for more comprehensive testing of the app’s functionality.

- **Scalability**: As the app grows in complexity, the architecture allows for the easy addition of new 
features. Clean Architecture’s layered approach means that changes in one layer (e.g., the data source) 
have minimal impact on other layers.

- **Maintainability**: The clear separation between layers makes it easier to refactor and update the 
app over time. Each layer can evolve independently, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs during updates.

### Layered Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - **View**: Composed of Jetpack Compose components, this layer handles the UI. It observes the 
   ViewModel and reacts to changes in the UI state.
    - **ViewModel**: The ViewModel fetches data from the Use Cases, processes it, and exposes it to 
   the View as LiveData or State. It handles UI-related logic and ensures that the View only updates when necessary.

2. **Domain Layer**:
    - **Use Cases**: This layer contains the business logic of the app. Each Use Case encapsulates a 
   specific piece of functionality, such as fetching weather data. The Use Cases are orchestrated by the ViewModel.

3. **Data Layer**:
    - **Repository Implementation**: The Repository implements the Repository Interface and is responsible 
   for fetching data from remote (via Retrofit) or local sources.
    - **Data Sources**: Includes the APIs, database, and other sources of data. In this app, Retrofit 
   is used for network calls to the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Technologies Used
BasicWeatherApp utilizes Gradle's new version catalog feature for managing dependencies, streamlining the
build process and ensuring consistency across projects. The key dependencies include:

* **Kotlin**: Core library for Kotlin development.
* **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps.
* **Hilt-android**: Dependency injection framework.
* **Retrofit**: Networking library for API calls.
* **Coroutines**: Library for managing asynchronous tasks.
* **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data for the app.
* **Compose Type-Safe Navigation**: Type-safe navigation for enhanced reliability and developer experience.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Kotlin **2.0.20** or later
- OpenWeatherMap API key

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BotsheloRamela/Kotlin-Basic-Weather-App
   cd BasicWeatherApp
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio:
    - Launch Android Studio.
    - Select "Open an existing project" and navigate to the cloned repository.

3. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
    - Create a file named `local.properties` in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the following line:
        ```properties
        API_KEY=your_api_key
        ```
4. Build and run the project:
    - Sync the Gradle files.
    - Build the project and run it on your emulator or connected device.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Unit tests cover the ViewModel and Use Cases to ensure business logic is correct.
- The Repository Interface is mocked to isolate the domain logic from the data sources.

### Run Tests
- Use the following command to run the tests:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew test
    ```
